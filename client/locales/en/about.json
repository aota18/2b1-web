    "first": "Surrey House of Restoration Street Church started in June 2000 in Vancouver, Canada. In Matthew 17:11-13, Jesus said of Elijah, \"He will come and restore everything.\" You mean John Baptist was the beginning of all the recovery. The House of Recovery began with the words 'Until you recover everything' in Acts 3:21 of the Apostles. Recovery was necessary in every era, and it is all the more desperately needed in this era.",
    "second": "The mission of the 'Surrey House of Restoration' is to restore all the world. According to the words of Acts 3:21 of the Apostles, Jesus returns immediately after the restoration of all things. The reason why Jesus' re-emergence is delayed is because of the unrepentant spirits. Jesus has already prepared all our places. If Jesus comes back now, are we confident of going to heaven? There will be too many people in the church who are destroyed because they do not repent.",
    "key": "Starting with Street People's ministry, the \"House of Restoration\" ministry will continue until the restoration of the Lord's body churches and the resurrection and universal recovery of Jesus."
