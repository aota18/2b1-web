    "first": "It started as a family living in Silicon Valley. One day, on my way back from Yosemite, in John 17:11, a Bible verse came to mind, “they may be one as we are one.” Oh, right. we can become one only with the gospel. While watching the world with endless conflict and polarization, we wanted to do things about reconciliation.",
    "second": "We started to look at the conflict zones and found that more than 30 borders in the world were conflict zones (Syria, Afghanistan, Sudan, Myanmar …etc ). Also We’ve seen that the United States itself is politically polarized. Among them, We saw the Korean Peninsula, which is facing the most acute confrontation since the Korean War in 1953 (not the end of the war).",
    "third": "So the “Korean Peninsula Becoming One by Gospel” became first project. At the end of first project, we will select the next project and leave a small footprint in resolving disputes, unnecessary conflicts, and polarization that undermines human dignity. We believe that ethnic conflicts, conflicts between the rich and the poor, conflicts between the economic system, and conflicts between neighbors and couples can be united by the gospel.",
    "key": "Our mission is to leave a small footprint in resolving conflicts, unnecessary conflicts, and polarization that undermines human dignity."
