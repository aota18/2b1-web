We focus on beauty rather than the things of political or military conflict. We would like to emphasize that Korea are one by introducing the people, nature and food of Korea. For the past 70 years, we have lived seperately with our own cultural identity, but now we must come together. \n We believe that true unity can only be achieved through the Gospel.",
